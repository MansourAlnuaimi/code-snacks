1. [arctan(x) calculator using power series representation](https://github.com/MansourAlnuaimi/code-snacks/blob/main/arctan.c)
> A program that calculates the value of arctan(x) or tan^{-1} (x) by representing arctan(x) as a power series.
Note that the program cannot calculate values of x that aren't from the interval [-1, 1].
2. [Base-b to Decimal number converter](https://github.com/MansourAlnuaimi/code-snacks/blob/main/base_b_converter.py)
> A program that takes the inputted number in any base-b, then it converts it to decimal (base-10)
